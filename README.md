# team-profile-generator

## Description

I was given a task to build from scratch a Node.js command-line application that takes in information about employees on a software engineering team, then generates an HTML webpage that displays summaries for each person. I also wrote a unit test for every part of my code and ensure that it passes each test.

## Getting started

```npm install```

## What we did

- install npm package
- install libraries like inquirer (prompts for user input) and jest (for testing)
- Build question prompting user input to enter their information in index.js file.
- Created four main function, on the bases that a manager is mandatory for a team  an add manager function was created followed by generate employee then generate html and then write to file as the wire frame of the project.  
- Once the user enters all the prompted questions an HTML file is generated that displays a nicely formatted team roster based on user input. 
- In the questions a list of options were created to select the role of the employee or exit. 
- Once you exit the application, the HTML is generated in team.html file.
